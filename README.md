# MongoDB findOne with Projection and Nested Documents

This example demonstrates a potential issue when using MongoDB's `findOne` method with a projection that omits the `_id` field while querying documents with nested structures. The projection may not behave as expected due to how MongoDB handles field selection during the query process. 

## Bug Description:
In the provided code snippet, the `findOne` method is used to query the `users` collection. The projection `{ _id: 0, name: 1 }` is used to retrieve only the `name` field, omitting the `_id` field.  However, if the `users` collection has documents with nested structures, the omitted `_id` field can interfere with how the projection selects other fields. The output might be inconsistent or not as intended.

## Solution:
The solution involves using the projection correctly to avoid unexpected behavior when working with nested documents. If you wish to include specific nested fields, you will need to specify the entire path to those fields.  Alternatively, retrieving the `_id` field, even if not displayed in the result, can often lead to the correct result.  If you truly need to omit the `_id` completely, careful testing is required to ensure the desired behavior.
